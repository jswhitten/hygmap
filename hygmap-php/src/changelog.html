               <h3>2025-6-6</h3>
               <ul>
                  <li>Added a search by proper name or catalog number.</li>
                  <li>Fixed the stellar-database links</li>
               </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
               <h3>2025-6-4</h3>
               <ul>
                  <li>Added a configuration page and moved some of the map settings there.</li>
                  <li>Units (light years or parsecs) may now be selected from the configuration page.</li>
                  <li>Grid size may now be configured</li>
                  <li>Selected stars should now stay selected if you move the map around.</li>
                  <li>Fictional names from multiple universes are now supported, though no others have been added yet.</li>                  
               </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
               <h3>2025-5-31</h3>
               <ul>
                  <li>Switched from mysql to postgres and imported the latest AT-HYG database (v3.2). It can now handle the entire database with no lag.</li>
                  <li>Dropped the GCNS additions for now. It's just the AT-HYG database currently.</li>
                  <li>Now running the php app and database in Docker containers.</li>
               </ul>
            </li>

	       <h3>2024-3-17</h3>
               <ul>
                  <li>Added XYZ coordinates to table</li>
                  <li>The table now only includes the stars bright enough to
                  be labelled</li>
               </ul>
            <li>
               <h3>2023-8-25</h3>
               <ul>
                  <li>Identified new stars with Cardassia, Bajor, Kronos, Romulus, and Romii using the more accurate data. The new Cardassia/Bajor were chosen to be more consistent with the spectral types in Star Charts as well as Regulus being about 300 light years away, according to Jake Sisko.
                  </li>
               </ul>
            </li>            
            <li>
               <h3>2023-8-20</h3>
               <ul>
                  <li>Imported the AT-HYG database with 2.5 million stars and Gaia distances. For performance reasons I'm removing all stars dimmer than magnitude 11 that are over 100 parsecs away, for now, leaving 1 million stars.
                  </li>
               </ul>
            </li>            
            <li>
               <h3>2023-8-11</h3>
               <ul>
                  <li>Moved db credentials to env variable.
                  </li>
               </ul>
            </li>            
            <li>
               <h3>2023-3-13</h3>
               <ul>
                  <li>Added a filter to only label bright stars.
                  </li>
               </ul>
            </li>            
            <li>
               <h3>2021-1-3</h3>
               <ul>
                  <li>The map will now label only the brighter star if two are right next to each other,
                     to improve readability.
                  </li>
               </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
               <h3>2020-12-31</h3>
               <ul>
                  <li>Imported the list of proper names from <a href="https://www.iau.org/public/themes/naming_stars/">the IAU</a></li>
               </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
               <h3>2020-12-30</h3>
               <ul>
                  <li>Rewrote all the old code to make it more efficient. Large maps that used to
                     take several seconds to render are now done in milliseconds.
                  </li>
                  <li>Updated the interface, keeping all the existing features.</li>
                  <li>Upgraded to the latest HYG database (v3).</li>
                  <li>Readded about 120 of the Star Trek stars that were missing from the db.</li>
                  <li>Moved to new domain.</li>
                  <li>Added to github.</li>
               </ul>

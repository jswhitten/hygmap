               <h3>2023-8-25</h3>
               <ul>
                  <li>Identified new stars with Cardassia, Bajor, Kronos, Romulus, and Romii using the more accurate data. The new Cardassia/Bajor were chosen to be more consistent with the spectral types in Star Charts as well as Regulus being about 300 light years away, according to Jake Sisko.

               <h3>2023-8-20</h3>
               <ul>
                  <li>Imported the AT-HYG database with 2.5 million stars and Gaia distances. For performance reasons I'm removing all stars dimmer than magnitude 11 that are over 100 parsecs away, for now, leaving 1 million stars.

               <ul>
                  <li>Added a filter to only label bright stars.

               <ul>
                  <li>The map will now label only the brighter star if two are right next to each other,
                     to improve readability.

               <ul>
                  <li>Imported the list of proper names from <a href="https://www.iau.org/public/themes/naming_stars/">the IAU</a></li>

            <li>
               <h3>2020-12-30</h3>
               <ul>
                  <li>Rewrote all the old code to make it more efficient. Large maps that used to
                     take several seconds to render are now done in milliseconds.
                  </li>
                  <li>Updated the interface, keeping all the existing features.</li>
                  <li>Upgraded to the latest HYG database (v3).</li>
                  <li>Readded about 120 of the Star Trek stars that were missing from the db.</li>
                  <li>Moved to new domain.</li>
                  <li>Added to github.</li>

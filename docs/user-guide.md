# HYGMap User Guide

Learn how to navigate and explore the star map with HygMap.

## Interface Overview

- **Control Panel** (left) - Navigation and filter controls
- **Star Map** (center) - Visual representation of stars
- **Star Table** (bottom) - List of visible stars

## Basic Navigation

### Setting Your Position

**Center Coordinates (X, Y, Z):**
- Your position in galactic coordinates (parsecs or light years)
- Default (0,0,0) is our solar system
- Click any star name in the table to center on it

**Zoom Controls:**
- **X/Y Zoom** - Distance from center to edge (smaller = zoomed in)
- **Z Zoom** - Depth of view ("up" and "down" distance)

## Understanding Stars

### Visual Elements

**Star Colors** (based on temperature):
- **Blue** - Hot stars
- **White** - Medium-hot stars  
- **Yellow** - Sun-like stars
- **Orange/Red** - Cool stars

**Star Sizes** based on brightness:
- Larger = brighter stars
- Smaller = dimmer stars

### Star Labels

Stars show the most prominent name available:
1. Proper names (Sirius, Vega)
2. Traditional designations (Alpha Centauri)
3. Catalog numbers (HD, Hipparcos)

**Fictional Names:** Check "Show fictional names" to see sci-fi locations (Star Trek, etc.) in yellow.

## Configuration

### Units and Grid Size

- Select between parsecs and light years
- Choose the spacing between grid lines in your selected units
- Optionally add lines between stars within a certain distance of each other

### Fictional Names

- Choose None to see only real star names, or a scifi universe to identify real stars with fictional planets

### Image Render

**Map Types**
- **Normal:** 2D overhead view of the galactic plane
- **3D:** Stereoscopic left/right images for depth perception
- **Printable:** Black and white version

**Image size**
- Adjust map resolution

### Magnitude Filters

**Show stars brighter than magnitude X:**
- Lower numbers = only brightest stars visible
- Higher numbers = more dim stars included

**Label stars brighter than magnitude X:**
- Controls which stars get name labels
- Prevents overcrowding

## Getting Started

1. **Default view:** Shows stars near the Sun
2. **Click star names** in the table to center on them
3. **Adjust zoom** to explore different scales
4. **Use magnitude filter** to reduce clutter
5. **Try fictional names** to visit famous sci-fi locations

## Sharing and Exporting

### Copy Link

Click the **Copy Link** button to copy a shareable URL to your clipboard. The link preserves your current view settings:
- Center coordinates (X, Y, Z)
- Zoom levels
- Magnitude filters
- Configuration options

Share this link with others to show them exactly what you're viewing.

### Export CSV

Click the **Export CSV** button to download a spreadsheet of all stars currently visible in your view. The CSV includes:
- Star names (proper names, Bayer/Flamsteed designations)
- Constellation
- Spectral type
- Apparent and absolute magnitude
- Distance in parsecs
- Galactic coordinates (X, Y, Z)
- Catalog IDs (Hipparcos, Henry Draper, Gliese)

Useful for:
- Research and analysis
- Creating custom star lists
- Importing into other applications

## Mobile Support

HYGMap works on tablets and phones with a responsive design:
- **Tablets (< 900px):** Controls stack vertically above the map
- **Phones (< 600px):** Compact layout with touch-friendly controls

All features work on mobile, including:
- Touch to center on stars
- Pinch-friendly coordinate inputs
- Copy Link and Export buttons

## Tips

- **Lower magnitude numbers** = fewer, brighter stars = cleaner view
- **3D view** helps understand stellar distances
- **Center on bright stars** (Sirius, Vega) for good reference points
- **Distance units:** 1 parsec ≈ 3.26 light years
- **Copy Link** to bookmark interesting views or share with friends
- **Export CSV** to analyze star data in a spreadsheet

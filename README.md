# HYGMap

Interactive 3D star mapping application showing nearby stars with real astronomical data and fictional sci-fi locations.

## Features

- **2,500,000+ stars** from the AT-HYG Database
- **3D galactic visualization** with zoom, pan, and filter controls
- **Fictional star names** from sci-fi universes (Star Trek, Babylon 5, etc.)
- **Real astronomical data** including spectral types, magnitudes, distances
- **Multiple view modes** - 2D galactic plane, 3D stereoscopic, printable
- **Fast PostgreSQL backend** with spatial indexing
- **Dockerized deployment** - runs anywhere

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jswhitten/hygmap.git
cd hygmap
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your desired database credentials
# Download AT-HYG CSV files to db/data directory
docker-compose up -d --build
```

Open http://localhost to start exploring the galaxy!

## How It Works

HYGMap displays stars in **galactic coordinates** centered on our solar system:

- **X-axis:** Points toward galactic center (~26,700 light years away)
- **Y-axis:** Points toward 90Â° galactic longitude (Cygnus direction) 
- **Z-axis:** Points "up" from the galactic plane
- **Origin (0,0,0):** Our Sun's position

The interface shows an overhead view of the galactic plane, with stars colored by spectral type and sized by brightness.

## Data Sources

- **[HYG Database](https://github.com/astronexus/HYG-Database)** - Compiled by David Nash
  - Hipparcos Catalog (satellite measurements)
  - Yale Bright Star Catalog (5th Edition)
  - Gliese Catalog of Nearby Stars (3rd Edition)

  I am using the new AT-HYG version of the database which includes over 2.5 million stars from the Tycho catalog and distances from Gaia

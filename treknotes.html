      <h2>Star Trek notes</h2>
      <p>
         <ul>
            <li><h3>Rigel</h3>There are two star systems that we've seen called Rigel.
            <ul>
               <li>
                  <p>
                  <h4>"Near" Rigel</h4>This is the one that was on the way to the Klingon Empire in
                  Enterprise, no more than a few dozen light years away. Also the one mentioned 
                  as the heading of the Doomsday Machine, with Earth "not far beyond". Star Charts calls
                  this Beta Rigel. Its location has been shown on maps on screen, and it's supposed to 
                  be an A type star, so I've picked Tau-3 Eridani as the A type star closest to the 
                  location in the maps.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>
                  <h4>"Far" Rigel</h4>This is the one that we saw in the Original Series and in Mudd's
                  Women, and this is the supergiant in Orion we call Rigel. It has the Kalar planet
                  Rigel VII as well as the dilithium mining planet Rigel XII.</p>
               </li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Deneb</h3>Similar to Rigel, there are two Denebs. The near one was mentioned in
               TOS, and the far one is Farpoint station from TNG.
               <ul>
                  <li>
                     <p>
                     <h4>"Near" Deneb</h4><p>Mentioned in TOS as Deneb II and V. Star Charts calls 
                        this <a href="index.php?trek_names=1&select_center=1&select_star=3413">Deneb Kaitos</a> 
                        so I went with that.
                     </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <p>
                     <h4>"Far" Deneb</h4></p> is the supergiant Alpha Cygni, and has Farpoint Station.

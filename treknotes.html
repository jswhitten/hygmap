      <h2>Star Trek notes</h2>
      <p>
         <ul>
            <li><h3>Romulus</h3>The star I picked for Romulus doesn't work so that will change in the future. 
               <a href="index.php?trek_names=1&select_center=1&select_star=65774">HD 117635</a>
               is a spectroscopic binary with a period that would make a stable orbit in either
               star's habitable zone impossible. The Hipparcos data that far out is incomplete
               and the distances not very accurate, so I'll need to pull in Gaia data.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Rigel</h3>Turns out there are two Rigels in Star Trek, and I don't think either of
            them are Beta Orionis. That star is too young to have terrestrial planets, let alone
            habitable ones.
            <ul>
               <li>
                  <p>
                  <h4>"Near" Rigel</h4>This is the one that was on the way to the Klingon Empire in
                  Enterprise, no more than a few dozen light years away. Also the one mentioned 
                  as the heading of the Doomsday Machine, with Earth "not far beyond". Star Charts calls
                  this Beta Rigel.</p>
                  <p>We don't name stars that way, but there are two other stars with traditional names 
                     starting with Rigel, and the closer one is in about the right place. This is 
                     <a href="index.php?trek_names=1&select_center=1&select_star=71731">Mu 
                     Virginis, Rigel Al Awwa</a>, so I've picked that one for the "near" Rigel.
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>
                  <h4>"Far" Rigel</h4>This is the one that we saw in the Original Series and in Mudd's
                  Women. <a href="index.php?trek_names=1&select_center=1&select_star=9618">Rigel Al Musalsalah (Gamma And)</a>
                  is at the right distance so I'm calling that one "far" Rigel.
                  </p>
                  <p>Now this star has the official name of Almach according to the IAU, but it is a
                     multiple star system and the name only applies to the primary star. Sometimes
                     other stars in the system are given alternate traditional names for the system 
                     (Rigel Kentaurus and Toliman, for example) so it's possible that Gamma-2 Andromedae
                     would be given this alternate name.</p>
               </li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Deneb</h3>Similar to Rigel, there are two Denebs. The near one was mentioned in
               TOS, and the far one is Farpoint station from TNG. Again, Alpha Cygni is too young
               to have a terrestrial planet.
               <ul>
                  <li>
                     <p>
                     <h4>"Near" Deneb</h4><p>Mentioned in TOS as Deneb II and V. Star Charts calls 
                        this <a href="index.php?trek_names=1&select_center=1&select_star=3413">Deneb Kaitos</a> 
                        so I went with that.
                     </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <p>
                     <h4>"Far" Deneb</h4></p><a href="index.php?trek_names=1&select_center=1&select_star=101095">Epsilon Delphini</a>
                     was sometimes called Deneb Dulfim and might be far enough away, but today it has the 
                     official name Aldulfin and no known companions. I think this one was intended to be 
                     Alpha Cygni so I may change it back.
